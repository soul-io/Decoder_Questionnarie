# Decoder Questionnaire

This project presents a short questionnaire for collecting responses about early favorites and personal tendencies. The questionnaire is delivered through a simple HTML page that posts the results to a remote webhook.

## Project files

- **index.html** – Main HTML page with the questionnaire form and embedded script.
- **script.js** – Placeholder for separate JavaScript logic if expanded in the future.
- **styles.css** – Styling rules for the questionnaire layout.
- **package.json** – Node package configuration for tooling and tests.

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in any web browser by double-clicking the file or using your browser's open dialog.
2. Fill in the form fields and submit to send the data to the specified endpoint.

## Testing

If the project includes a `package.json` file with test scripts, run:

```bash
npm test
```

This will execute any configured tests through the Node.js package manager.
